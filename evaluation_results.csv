What is the method to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon?,"Turn off auto-save, use a Master Ball or set up the Pokémon with False Swipe and a status effect move.","According to the text, to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon, it is recommended to:

1. Turn off Auto-save in the Options before attempting to catch the legendary Pokémon.
2. Do a hard save before fighting the legendary Pokémon.
3. Use a Pokémon with the moves False Swipe and a status effect move, such as Yawn, Hypnosis, or Thunder Wave.
4. Use a Pokémon that can learn False Swipe, such as Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus, or Persian.

By following these steps, you can increase your chances of successfully catching legendary Pokémon.","[['Catching Legendaries After the credits you can return to the academy and talk to Director Calvell and receive your Master ball. You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land. If you do your classes at school you will learn all about it and get a side-quest about it from the History teacher.', 'Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp. Points gained ● Item Drop Power : More materials found after battles ● Title Power: More likely to find Pokemon with titles ● Sparkling Power: More likely to find Shiny Pokemon ● Humungo Power: More likely to find large Pokemon', 'Victory Road The Pokemon League - Defeating The Elite Four How to Find the Pokemon League It’s located in the back of Mesagoza, in the Northwest corner. You are looking for a gate and tunnel pictured below behind some buildings. Follow the grass to the pokemon center, ﬁght the trainers if you want to. When you enter the gym-like building in the back the challenge is on, so be ready! Prepare with these types of pokemon: F o r t h e ﬁ r s t b a t t l e : Grass, Ground, Ice and Psychic-type F o r t h e s e c o n d b a t t l e : Fire, Ground, Fighting, Dark, Ghost and Electric-type F o r t h e t h i r d b a t t l e : Rock, Electric, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy-type F o r t h e f o u r t h b a t t l e : Ice, Fairy, and Dragon-type F o r t h e ﬁ f t h b a t t l e : Dark, Ghost, Electric, Fighting, Fire, Ground, and Water-type I know it looks overwhelming, but you don’t have to have all those types, just having some di\x00erent moves works well, like ghost moves on your dark type or ﬁghting or ground types moves, even if the pokemon is not that type is enough.', 'A Challenge From Nemona Victory Road Finale Nemona is also a Pokemon Champion, and much like you, defeated the Elite Four, so can you prove you’re the very best? R e c o m m e n d e d L e v e l 6 5 - 6 6 L e v e l P o k e m o n T y p e Lvl 65 Lycanoc Rock Lvl 65 Pawmot Electric/Fighting Lvl 65 Goodra Dragon Lvl 65 Dundunsparce Normal Lvl 65 Orthworm Steel Lvl 66 Starter Pokemon Fire/Water/Grass ● Lycanroc is weak to Fighting, Grass and Ground types . ● Dundunsprace is also weak to Fighting . ● Pawmot is weak to Ground , as well as Fairy and Ice . ● Goodra is weak to Dragon, Ice and Fairy. ● Orthworm is weak to Fighting, Fire and Ground. So if you have a good Ground, Fairy and maybe someone with a strong Fighting move like Close combat. It will take you a long way.']]",0.8,0.9647191481646814,0.9999999999,0.02127659574468085,1.0,0.6666666644444444,0.8796529842655006,0.5199132460663752
