What are the starting choices for Pokémon in Paldea?,"The starter Pokémon options in Paldea are Sprigatito (Grass), Fuecoco (Fire), and Quaxly (Water).","According to the provided context, the starting Pokémon choices in Paldea are not explicitly stated. However, it is mentioned that you can get Charcadet, the new fire-type Pokémon, right after finishing the conversations in the school. It is also mentioned that you should think about building your team, considering having someone with fire, water, electric, etc. types.

In other Pokémon games, the traditional starting Pokémon are usually Grass, Fire, and Water types. However, it is not explicitly stated in the provided context what the exact starting choices are in Paldea.","[['● Teensy Power : More likely to find small Pokemon ● (Type) Encounter Power : More likely to find (Type) Pokemon ● Raid Power: Earn more items in Tera Raid Battles Egg Power will be important when you want to start breeding since in this game, you breed by having a ditto, and one other pokemon in your party in a picnic and you check the small picnic basket next to the table every so often to see if you have any eggs, if you have many eggs they will just go to your boxes. (Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school. So try to think about how you might want to build your team, since you will probably want someone with fire, water, electric etc. Especially since the first two gyms are weak to fire.', 'This pokemon game is set in the region of Paldea, after a good amount of talking through the beginning of the game you will find there are three main story-lines or Quests to accomplish, and they can be done in any order at any time. The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Pokemo\x00 Scarle\x00 An\x00 Viole\x00 Walkthroug\x00 Scarlet players will have the opportunity to catch and ride K o raidon .
