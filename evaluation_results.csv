What pokemon does Montenevera Chost Gym leader use?,"Rymn, the gym leader for Montenevera Ghost Gym uses the following pokemon:
Banette (Ghost)- Lvl 41,
Mimikyu (Ghost/Fairy)- Lvl 41,
Houndstone (Ghost)- Lvl 41,
Toxtricity (Electric/Poison)- Lvl 42 which will Terastallize into Ghost type","According to the text, the Montenevera Ghost Gym leader, Rymn, uses the following Pokémon:

* Banette (Ghost) - Level 41
* Mimikyu (Ghost/Fairy) - Level 41
* Houndstone (Ghost) - Level 41
* Toxtricity (Electric/Poison) - Level 42","[['Gym #4 - Cascarrafa Water Gym - Kofu ● Veluza (Water/Psychic)- Lvl 29 ● Wugtrio (Water)- Lvl 29 ● Crabominable (Fighting/Ice)- Lvl 30 ~Tera into Water W e a k n e s s : Electric, Grass Meowscarada is perfect for this gym, another great options is wattrel, or its evolution. Pawmot, Raichu, Magneton, you get the idea, anything electric, or if you’ve been a fan of Smoliv, it’s her time to shine! Gym #5 - Medali Normal Gym - Larry ● Komala (Normal)- Lvl 35 ● Dundunsparce (Normal)- Lvl 35 ● Staraptor (Flying/Normal)- lvl 36 ~Tera into Normal W e a k n e s s : Fighting Larry is a new fan favorite gym leader! Since we haven’t had a Normal type gym leader in a long time. His Staraptor is particularly dangerous, since its ﬂying moves will destroy any ﬁghting type pokemon you bring out. It is suggested you use a move to poison or burn the pokemon so even if it gives you trouble will-o-wisp can be doing damage as you try to ﬁgure out a way to deal with it. Rock can be useful, or just a pokemon with ﬁghting moves. Gym #6 - Montenevera Ghost Gym - Rymn ● Banette (Ghost)- Lvl 41 ● Mimikyu (Ghost/Fairy)- Lvl 41 ● Houndstone (Ghost)- Lvl 41 ● Toxtricity (Electric/Poison)- Lvl 42 ~Tera into Ghost W e a k n e s s : Dark, Ghost Dark type pokemon are key here, but those who picked Fuecoco should be able to burn and Hex their way through while Sprigatito users should be able to remember Night Slash if you forgot that move and rip this gym apart. Myself, I used one of my many dog pokemon and Crunched my way to victory.', 'Gym #7 - Alfornada Psychic Gym - Tulip ● Farigiraf (Normal/Psychic)- Lvl 44 ● Gardevoir (Fairy/Psychic)- Lvl 44 ● Espathra (Psychic)- Lvl 44 ● Florges (Fairy)- Lvl 45 ~Tera into Psychic W e a k n e s s : Ghost, Dark, Bug Another tricky gym leader, Farigiraf is Normal/Psychic. Where Ghost moves might have been e\x00ective for most psychic types they will just pass right through being immune to Farigiraf, hit it with Dark or Bug. Similarly, Gardevoir is Fairy/Psychic, so Dark types are going to be in trouble against her. Poison Type moves would be Super e\x00ect, but be careful with poison type pokemon since the psychic type moves will obliterate them. A good option here is Bisharp, Iron Head is a strong ability and Knock o\x00 and Night slash are some dark moves he learns you can use in the ﬁght. Gym #8 - Glaseado Ice Gym - Grusha ● Frosmoth (Ice/Bug)- Lvl 47 ● Beartic (Ice)- Lvl 47 ● Cetitan (Ice)- Lvl 47 ● Altaria (Dragon/Flying)- Lvl 48 ~Tera into Ice W e a k n e s s : Fire, Rock, Steel, Fighting Cetitan is a HP sponge and has high attack. On top of that it has the ability Thick fat which allows it to absorb 50% of all ﬁre attacks, and is equipped with liquidation to take out your ﬁre pokemon! Consider using rock, steel or ﬁghting against Cetitan instead of ﬁre since it is ready for your ﬁre pokemon! The last and toughest is Altaria, which would normally be x4 weak to Ice is then terastallized into Ice. How to deal with this cloud-bird, if you still have a Bisharp those steel moves will shine here. Tinkaton with her large hammer will also smash her way to victory!', 'Gym #1 - Cortondo Bug Gym - Katy ● Nymble (Bug)- Lvl 14 ● Tarountula (Bug)- Lvl 14 ● Teddiursa (Normal)- Lvl 15 ~Tera into bug type W e a k n e s s : Fire, Flying, Rock You will ﬁnd out pretty quickly that all the major ﬁghts in their game will end with the ﬁnal pokemon the person throws out being terastalized. So even if a teddiursa is a normal type pokemon it is now a bug type because it terastalized into a bug type and is weak to the same things bugs would be weak too. So treat it the same way you would a bug type. Gym #2 - Artazon Grass Gym - Brassius ● Petilil (Grass)- Lvl 16 ● Smoliv (Grass/Normal)- Lvl 16 ● Sudowoodo (Rock)- Lvl 17 ~Tera into grass W e a k n e s s : Fire, Flying, Ice If you’ve picked up a Fletching, Charcadet or have the ﬁre starter Fuecoco, they are going to be putting in some work by this second gym. Gym #3 - Levincia Electric Gym - Iono ● Wattrel (Flying/Electric)- Lvl 23 ● Bellibot (Electric)- Lvl 23 ● Luxio (Electric)- Lvl 23 ● Mismagius (Ghost)- Lvl 24 ~Tera into Electric W e a k n e s s : Ground Despite the ground weakness, Iono is tricky. Wattrel is ﬂying and isn’t a\x00ected by ground moves, and Mismagius is a ghost type with the ability, levitate and thus is immune to ground moves as well. So bringing a ground type isn’t a bad plan, but maybe bringing a pokemon with ground moves is enough to take out luxio and bellibot, then using rock on wattrel to hurt it’s ﬂying type. The Mismagius is just going to be tricky, dark is good against ghosts, but it will terastallize into electric, so just do what you can.', 'Gym Challenge Mission Here is a simple run down of the gyms.

She asks you to meet at night because her pokemon know the move moonblast which is a fairy-type move only use-able at night. Since Penny has a good spread of pokemon you will need an equally good spread to counter her, and something to deal with her sylveon which she will terastallize into a Fairy type.

Gyarados will fall quickly to E l e c t r i c . Oranguru and Polteageist will crack up to D a r k types.

You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land. If you do your classes at school you will learn all about it and get a side-quest about it from the History teacher.']]",1.0,0.9642002288669707,0.9999999999,0.030303030303030304,1.0,0.999999995,0.9600721895281121,0.990018047382028
How does fast travel work in the game?,Fast travel is unlocked immediately and can be used at any Pokémon center and certain mysterious towers.,"According to the provided context, fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game, and all Pokémon Centers are fast travel locations. Additionally, some Mysterious Towers can also be unlocked as fast travel locations if you climb to the top of them.","[['Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp. Points gained ● Item Drop Power : More materials found after battles ● Title Power: More likely to find Pokemon with titles ● Sparkling Power: More likely to find Shiny Pokemon ● Humungo Power: More likely to find large Pokemon', 'that your friends will help you out with.

The Professor will be using all paradon pokemon from whichever game you are playing, Violet/Scarlet. Which on a ﬁrst-time playing is pretty rough since you don’t really know the type match-ups against those pokemon yet since they’re all new and not what you are probably expecting since it might look like Steel but there is no steel among them. Or it might look like a Tyrannitar but it’s not.
