Here’s a method to ensure a successful catch:

1. Prepare Your Team
Status Moves: Bring Pokémon with moves that can inflict status conditions such as Sleep (e.g., Sleep Powder, Hypnosis) or Paralysis (e.g., Thunder Wave). Sleep is generally the most effective status condition for increasing catch rates.

Timer Balls: These become more effective the longer the battle lasts. Use them if the battle has gone on for many turns.
Dusk Balls: If you’re in a cave or battling at night, Dusk Balls are very effective.
Master Ball: If you have a Master Ball, it guarantees a catch. Use it if you’re having a lot of trouble catching the legendary Pokémon and don’t want to risk it escaping.
5. Save Your Game
Save your game before initiating the battle with the legendary Pokémon. This allows you to restart if you accidentally knock it out or run out of Poké Balls.

"I'm trying to get a Marill, how do I do that?","Pokemon that require a high level of friendship to evolve: Don’t forget luxury balls, soothe bells (hold item purchased at the Delibird store), and using picnics and washing your pokemon at the picnic can all help raise their friendship with them faster. Azurill + friendship = Marill","To get a Marill in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, you have a couple of options: catching one in the wild or evolving an Azurill. Here are the steps for both methods:

Method 1: Catching Marill in the Wild
Locations: Marill can be found in various locations in the Paldea region. They are often found near bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds.

Example Locations: Check around South Province (Area Four), West Province (Area Three), and other similar areas with water sources.
Time and Weather: Some Pokémon are more likely to appear during specific times of day or weather conditions. While Marill is generally not time-specific, exploring during the day can be helpful for visibility.

Method 2: Evolving an Azurill
Catch an Azurill: Azurill can be found in areas similar to where Marill is found. They are often seen near bodies of water.

Example Locations: South Province (Area One) and other water-adjacent areas.
Friendship Evolution: To evolve Azurill into Marill, you need to increase its friendship level. Here are some ways to do this:

Walk with Azurill: Keep Azurill in your party and walk around to increase friendship.
Battle and Win: Use Azurill in battles and avoid letting it faint.
Give Soothe Bell: Equip Azurill with a Soothe Bell to increase the rate at which it gains friendship. You can get a Soothe Bell from Delibird Presents shops or as a reward from NPCs.
Feed Berries: Give Azurill berries that increase friendship, such as Sitrus Berries.
Check Friendship Level: To check Azurill’s friendship level, you can talk to an NPC who evaluates friendship in towns like Mesagoza.

Level Up: Once Azurill’s friendship level is high enough, level it up, and it will evolve into Marill.

By following these methods, you can successfully obtain a Marill in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Happy hunting!"

Check Friendship Levels: Ensure the Pokémon remains outside for the entire duration to avoid resetting the step count.

Level Up the Pokémon: After walking the required steps, level up the Pokémon either by battling or using experience items like Rare Candies or Exp. Candies. The Pokémon should evolve upon leveling up.
