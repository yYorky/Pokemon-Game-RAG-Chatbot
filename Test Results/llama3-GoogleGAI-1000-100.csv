This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting.
