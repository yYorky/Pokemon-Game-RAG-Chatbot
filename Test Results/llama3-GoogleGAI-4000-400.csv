What are the starting choices for Pokémon in Paldea?,"The starter Pokémon options in Paldea are Sprigatito (Grass), Fuecoco (Fire), and Quaxly (Water).","The starting choices for Pokémon in Paldea are Fidough, Sprigatito, and Quaxly.","[['● Teensy Power : More likely to find small Pokemon ● (Type) Encounter Power : More likely to find (Type) Pokemon ● Raid Power: Earn more items in Tera Raid Battles Egg Power will be important when you want to start breeding since in this game, you breed by having a ditto, and one other pokemon in your party in a picnic and you check the small picnic basket next to the table every so often to see if you have any eggs, if you have many eggs they will just go to your boxes. (Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs.

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Pokemo\x00 Scarle\x00 An\x00 Viole\x00 Walkthroug\x00 Scarlet players will have the opportunity to catch and ride K o raidon .

All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp.

You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary.

All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game.

"What is the significance of the ""Area Zero"" mission?",It's a deep exploration mission involving the game's lore and culminates in battling the version's professor.,"According to the text, the ""Area Zero"" mission is the final mission in the main game, where you enter Area Zero with your Legendary Pokémon and friends to uncover the truth about Arven's Mom/Dad. You'll trek down deeper into Area Zero, discovering 4 Research stations, fighting wild Pokémon along the way, and ultimately, you'll face the Professor in a big fight in the Area Zero Lab.","[['The Way Home - Zero Gate The ﬁnal mission in the main game is to enter Area Zero. You can ﬁnd the Zero Gate Northwest of Medali, you can climb up to a small gate or climb up and over the mountain there. And enter a large domed building to ﬁnd your trio of friends preparing to enter Area Zero with your Legendary pokemon together. Here you trek down deeper and deeper into Area Zero discovering the 4 Research stations. At each Research Station there will be a single ﬁght with a wild pokemon', 'that your friends will help you out with.

There is no map in this area, just keep heading downward, almost in a natural spiral-like pattern and you will ﬁnd all the stations and eventually down into the crystal-like caverns which is the ﬁnal 4th station. Upon ﬁnding the last station is pretty destroyed you might feel that things are pretty suspicious with the professor. Continue down to the bottom and ﬁght your way, with your friends, into the Area Zero Lab! Enter the Lab and ﬁnd out the truth about Arvens Mom/Dad. While in the lab, pick up the pokeball on the ﬂoor for an important item, the B o o s t E n e r g y . The Professor will explain they would like you to turn o\x00 the time machine, but if you do that they will be forced to ﬁght you. You have to place the book Arven gave you earlier on the pedestal in the middle of the large shining room to turn o\x00 the machine. Do so, but be ready for a big ﬁght! The Professor will be using all paradon pokemon from whichever game you are playing, Violet/Scarlet. Which on a ﬁrst-time playing is pretty rough since you don’t really know the type match-ups against those pokemon yet since they’re all new and not what you are probably expecting since it might look like Steel but there is no steel among them. Or it might look like a Tyrannitar but it’s not. So you have to re-learn all these past/future pokemon.', 'Catching Legendaries After the credits you can return to the academy and talk to Director Calvell and receive your Master ball. You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land. If you do your classes at school you will learn all about it and get a side-quest about it from the History teacher.', ""\x00\x00 Lab o\x00 Poc\x00 Pat\x00 A Challenge from Arven After defeating the 5 Titan pokemon you will be asked to meet Arven at the Lighthouse where you met your legendary mount pokemon.

(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon.

Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet.

What is the method to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon?,"Turn off auto-save, use a Master Ball or set up the Pokémon with False Swipe and a status effect move.","According to the text, the recommended method to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon is to:

1. Turn off Auto-save in the Options before attempting to catch the legendary Pokémon. This way, if you knock out the legendary Pokémon, you can restart and try again without losing your progress.
2. Make a hard save before attempting to catch the legendary Pokémon, so you can restart from that point if needed.
3. Use a Pokémon specifically designed for catching, with moves like False Swipe and a status effect move (like Yawn, Hypnosis, or Thunder Wave). Some good candidates for this role are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus, and Persian.

By following these steps, you can increase your chances of successfully catching legendary Pokémon.","[['Catching Legendaries After the credits you can return to the academy and talk to Director Calvell and receive your Master ball. You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land.

Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area.

You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary.

You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon.

Additionally, the text suggests unlocking fast travel locations by visiting Pokémon centers and mysterious towers, which can help you move around the map more efficiently.","[['This pokemon game is set in the region of Paldea, after a good amount of talking through the beginning of the game you will find there are three main story-lines or Quests to accomplish, and they can be done in any order at any time. The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp. Points gained ● Item Drop Power : More materials found after battles ● Title Power: More likely to find Pokemon with titles ● Sparkling Power: More likely to find Shiny Pokemon ● Humungo Power: More likely to find large Pokemon', '● Teensy Power : More likely to find small Pokemon ● (Type) Encounter Power : More likely to find (Type) Pokemon ● Raid Power: Earn more items in Tera Raid Battles Egg Power will be important when you want to start breeding since in this game, you breed by having a ditto, and one other pokemon in your party in a picnic and you check the small picnic basket next to the table every so often to see if you have any eggs, if you have many eggs they will just go to your boxes. (Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school. So try to think about how you might want to build your team, since you will probably want someone with fire, water, electric etc. Especially since the first two gyms are weak to fire.', 'that your friends will help you out with.

The weakness of the Ghost-type Pokémon is Dark-type moves. If you have a Pokémon with Dark-type moves, such as Bisharp or a Pokémon with the move Crunch, it would be a good choice for this gym.

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting.

So I found in the city of Levinicia there is a circle you can walk almost like a track, and if you walk it 4 times, you can pretty much be sure that you’ve done 1000 steps.

(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs.

You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school.
