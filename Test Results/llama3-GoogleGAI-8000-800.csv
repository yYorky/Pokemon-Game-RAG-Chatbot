What are the starting choices for Pokémon in Paldea?,"The starter Pokémon options in Paldea are Sprigatito (Grass), Fuecoco (Fire), and Quaxly (Water).","According to the text, the starting Pokémon choices in Paldea are:

* Fidough
* The new Paldea Wooper
* Charcadet (the new fire-type Pokémon)

These are not traditional starter Pokémon, but rather Pokémon that can be caught early in the game.","[['● Teensy Power : More likely to find small Pokemon ● (Type) Encounter Power : More likely to find (Type) Pokemon ● Raid Power: Earn more items in Tera Raid Battles Egg Power will be important when you want to start breeding since in this game, you breed by having a ditto, and one other pokemon in your party in a picnic and you check the small picnic basket next to the table every so often to see if you have any eggs, if you have many eggs they will just go to your boxes. (Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school. So try to think about how you might want to build your team, since you will probably want someone with fire, water, electric etc. Especially since the first two gyms are weak to fire.', 'This pokemon game is set in the region of Paldea, after a good amount of talking through the beginning of the game you will find there are three main story-lines or Quests to accomplish, and they can be done in any order at any time. The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Pokemo\x00 Scarle\x00 An\x00 Viole\x00 Walkthroug\x00 Scarlet players will have the opportunity to catch and ride K o raidon .

How does fast travel work in the game?,Fast travel is unlocked immediately and can be used at any Pokémon center and certain mysterious towers.,"According to the text, fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game.

All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp.

1. Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokémon Eggs.

These benefits can be useful for various activities, such as leveling up, capturing Pokémon, shiny hunting, and breeding.","[['Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game. All Sandwich Abilities : - Sandwich duration - 30 min. ● Egg Power: Increased chance to find Pokemon Eggs ● Catching Power : Increased chance that captures will succeed ● Exp. Point Power: More Exp.

So you can save some rare ingredients. I would also recommend, if you intend on shiny hunting with a special sandwich, make sure to save your game first, turn off autosave so if you don’t find any shiny pokemon you can just turn off your game and you won’t have lost your ingredients, and you can start again. You can also pause the timer on your sandwich if you hit the Home button on your switch, but not if you’re just in the Menus or Boxes in pokemon.

Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet.

What is the method to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon?,"Turn off auto-save, use a Master Ball or set up the Pokémon with False Swipe and a status effect move.","According to the provided text, the recommended method to ensure a successful catch of legendary Pokémon is to:

1. Turn off Auto-save in the Options before fighting the legendary Pokémon. This allows you to restart without worrying about losing progress if you knock out the legendary Pokémon.
2. Do a hard save before fighting the legendary Pokémon, and then turn Auto-save back on once you're happy with the outcome.
3. Use a Pokémon designed specifically for catching, with moves like False Swipe and a status effect move (like Yawn, Hypnosis, or Thunder Wave). This increases the chances of a successful catch.

Or it might look like a Tyrannitar but it’s not. So you have to re-learn all these past/future pokemon.', 'The Way Home - Zero Gate The ﬁnal mission in the main game is to enter Area Zero.

You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land. If you do your classes at school you will learn all about it and get a side-quest about it from the History teacher.']]",1.0,0.9853452223734115,0.999999999975,0.044444444444444446,1.0,0.0,0.9665921714106885,0.9916480428526722

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting.

All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that.

(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school. So try to think about how you might want to build your team, since you will probably want someone with fire, water, electric etc. Especially since the first two gyms are weak to fire.']]",1.0,0.8152018115839516,0.9999999999,0.02,1.0,0.0,0.9053175670972371,0.45709862254354006

* If you have a Sprigatito, you can use Night Slash to take out Rymn's Pokémon.

You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves. With your Master Ball in hand, go catch yourself a second Miraidon/Koraidon. You will always have the one you use as a bike, but the one you fought is just waiting for you down in the bottom of Area Zero, behind the Area Zero Lab where you fought the Professor. The games mascot pokemon is nature and ‘best’ IV locked with Miraidon being modest nature and Koraidon being adamant. There are four legendaries besides Miraidon/Koraidon. To gain access to them you must free them from their prisons, since they were long ago sealed for being destroyers of this land.

"How does the ""Let's Go"" feature affect Pokémon evolution?",Certain Pokémon evolve after walking a required number of steps with them outside of their Poké Ball.,"According to the text, the ""Let's Go"" feature (activated by pressing the Right bumper, R) is used to evolve certain Pokémon by walking with them. Specifically, the Pokémon that require walking with Let's Go to evolve are:

* Pawmo evolves into Pawmot after walking 1,000 steps
* Bramblin evolves into Brambleghast after walking 1,000 steps
* Rellor evolves into Rabsca after walking 1,000 steps

It's worth noting that the game doesn't have a built-in step counter, so players need to find ways to track their progress. The text suggests walking in a circle in the city of Levinicia, which has a track-like path, to help keep track of the steps.","[[""Pokemon that require a high level of friendship to evolve: Don’t forget luxury balls, soothe bells (hold item purchased at the Delibird store), and using picnics and washing your pokemon at the picnic can all help raise their friendship with them faster. ● Eevee + friendship = Espeon (daytime only) ● Eevee + friendship = Umbreon (nighttime only) ● Eevee + friendship + knows a fairy-type move = Sylveon ● Pichu + friendship = Pikachu ● Igglybu\x00 + friendship = Jigglypu\x00 ● Chansey + friendship = Blissey ● Azurill + friendship = Marill ● Riolu + friendship = Lucario (daytime only) Pokemon that require walking with Let’s Go (Right bumper, R) to evolve: ● Pawmo + walking 1,000 steps = Pawmot ● Bramblin + walking 1,000 steps = Brambleghast ● Rellor + walking 1,000 steps = Rabsca This can be hard because the game has no way of counting your steps, also if the pokemon returns to its ball while you're walking, or you’re interrupted in your walk, it can reset your steps. So I found in the city of Levinicia there is a circle you can walk almost like a track, and if you walk it 4 times, you can pretty much be sure that you’ve done 1000 steps. Then you level up your pokemon and you will see if you’ve got enough steps. Pokemon that require a special move to evolve: ● Eevee + friendship + knows a fairy-type move = Sylveon ● Girafarig + knows Twin Beam (level 32) = Farigiraf ● Dunspace + knows Hyper Drill (level 32) = Dudunsparce ● Bonsly + knows Mimic (level 16) = Sudowoodo ● Steenee + knows Stomp (level 28) = Tsareena"", 'Pok\x00\x00\x00\x00 an\x00 Evo\x00\x00\x00\x00on Pokemon who require stones to evolve: ● Eevee + Fire Stone = Flareon ● Growlithe + Fire Stone = Arcanine ● Capsakid + Fire Stone = Scovillain ● Eevee + Water Stone = Vaporeon ● Shellder + Water Stone = Cloyster ● Pikachu + Thunder Stone = Raichu ● Eevee + Thunder Stone = Jolteon ● Magneton + Thunder Stone = Magnezone ● Tadbulb + Thunder Stone = Bellibolt ● Eevee + Leaf Stone = Leafeon ● Petilil + Sun Stone = Lilligant ● Sunkern + Sun Stone = Sunﬂora ● Eevee + Ice Stone = Glaceon ● Cetoddle + Ice Stone = Cetitan ● Crabrawler + Ice Stone = Crabominable ● Jigglypu\x00 + Moon Stone = Wigglytu\x00 ● Floette + Shiny Stone = Florges ● Murkrow + Dusk Stone = Honchkrow ● Misdreavus + Dusk Stone = Mismagius ● Kirlia (male) + Dawn Stone = Gallade ● Snorunt (female) + Dawn Stone = Froslass Pokemon who need other items to evolve: ● Sinistea (Antique Form) + Chipped Pot = Polteageist ● Sinistea (Phony Form) + Cracked Pot = Polteageist ● Applin + Sweet Apple = Appletun ● Applin + Tart Apple = Flapple ● Charcadet + Auspicious Armor = Armarouge - S c a r l e t ● Charcadet + Malicious Armor = Ceruledge - V i o l e t ● Gimmighoul + 999 Gimmighoul Coins = Gholdengo', 'Pokemon that require speciﬁc Times of day to Evolve: ● Sneasel + holding Razor Claw + level = Weavile (nighttime only) ● Eevee + friendship = Espeon (daytime only) ● Eevee + friendship = Umbreon (nighttime only) ● Riolu + friendship = Lucario (daytime only) ● Happiny + holding Oval Stone + level = Chansey (daytime only) ● Yungoos + level 20 = Gumshoos (daytime only) ● Rockru\x00 + level 25 = Midday Form Lycanroc (daytime only) ● Rockru\x00 + level 25 = Midnight Form Lycanroc (nighttime only) ● Rockru\x00 with the “Own Tempo” ability + level 25 = Dusk Form Lycanroc (7-8 pm only) ● Fomantis + level 34 = Lurantis (daytime only) ● Greavard + level 30 = Houndstone (nighttime only) Pokemon that need to be traded to Evolve: ● Haunter + trade = Gengar ● Slowpoke + holding King’s Rock + trade = Slowking ● Scyther + holding Metal Coat + trade = Scizor', '● Teensy Power : More likely to find small Pokemon ● (Type) Encounter Power : More likely to find (Type) Pokemon ● Raid Power: Earn more items in Tera Raid Battles Egg Power will be important when you want to start breeding since in this game, you breed by having a ditto, and one other pokemon in your party in a picnic and you check the small picnic basket next to the table every so often to see if you have any eggs, if you have many eggs they will just go to your boxes. (Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early. There is also Charcadet, the new fire pokemon of this game you can get right after you finish talking to everyone in the school. So try to think about how you might want to build your team, since you will probably want someone with fire, water, electric etc. Especially since the first two gyms are weak to fire.']]",0.6666666666666666,0.8877462225635822,0.9999999999,0.125,1.0,0.0,0.879557982168643,0.40738949554216075

You will also unlock the extra mission to defeat all the Pokemon gyms an additional time, and then compete in a school-wide tournament. When trying to catch Ledendary pokemon, I recommend turning Auto-save OFF in your Options, if you knock out the legendaries you will get a chance to catch them again. However if you want to save yourself some money on expensive pokeballs, or you might have a bad run. You can always restart without worry if you just turn o\x00 autosave, do a hard save before you are about to ﬁght the legendary and then you can turn the auto saves back on when you are happy with your new legendary. I would also recommend, if you haven’t already, making a pokemon designed to catch other pokemon, one which knows two moves speciﬁcally, False Swipe and a status E\x00ect move, like Yawn, Hypnosis, Thunder Wave etc. You earn the ™ False Swipe from Professor Jacq after you have done your ﬁrst biology class with him and have 30 pokemon in your pokedex then there will be a red exclamation mark in the biology lab for you to go talk to him. Some good candidates in Scarlet and Violet are Gallade, Breloom, Bisharp/Kingambit, Scizor, Haxorus and Persian. They all can learn False Swipe and several other good status moves.
