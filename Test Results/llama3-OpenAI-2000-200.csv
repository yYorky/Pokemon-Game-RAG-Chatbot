(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs.

Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet.

What is a recommended tactic for leveling up quickly?,"Eating a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase normal encounter rates, especially useful for finding Chansey which can give a lot of experience if you KO it.","Unfortunately, there is no specific tactic for leveling up quickly mentioned in the provided context. However, it does suggest some general tips, such as using luxury balls, soothe bells, and picnics to raise friendship levels, which can help with evolving certain Pokémon. Additionally, it mentions the importance of having a well-rounded team with strong moves to take on battles.

If you're looking for general tips on leveling up quickly in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, I can offer some general advice:

* Focus on completing the main story and defeating Gym Leaders to earn a large amount of experience points.
* Battle wild Pokémon and other trainers to earn experience points and level up your Pokémon.
* Use EXP-boosting items, such as EXP Candy or Rare Candy, to give your Pokémon an experience boost.
* Make sure to heal your Pokémon regularly and use revives to avoid losing experience points when they faint.
* Consider using a Pokémon with a high catch rate to catch wild Pokémon and earn experience points.

Keep in mind that these are general tips and may not be specific to Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. If you're looking for more specific advice, I recommend checking out online resources or guides specific to the games.","[['Pokemo\x00 Scarle\x00 An\x00 Viole\x00 Walkthroug\x00 Scarlet players will have the opportunity to catch and ride K o raidon .

This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game.

(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon. You will see a glowing crystal in the distance, they also appear on your map. Intro to the Game Do the tutorial, get your first pokemon, meet your new best friend/rival. Then the game backs off a little and lets you explore, I think I spent way too long just exploring in this first zone, but it was just so fun, so I’ll point out some things you can collect in this first zone! Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early.

Pawmot, Raichu, Magneton, you get the idea, anything electric, or if you’ve been a fan of Smoliv, it’s her time to shine! Gym #5 - Medali Normal Gym - Larry ● Komala (Normal)- Lvl 35 ● Dundunsparce (Normal)- Lvl 35 ● Staraptor (Flying/Normal)- lvl 36 ~Tera into Normal W e a k n e s s : Fighting Larry is a new fan favorite gym leader! Since we haven’t had a Normal type gym leader in a long time. His Staraptor is particularly dangerous, since its ﬂying moves will destroy any ﬁghting type pokemon you bring out. It is suggested you use a move to poison or burn the pokemon so even if it gives you trouble will-o-wisp can be doing damage as you try to ﬁgure out a way to deal with it. Rock can be useful, or just a pokemon with ﬁghting moves.

Where Ghost moves might have been e\x00ective for most psychic types they will just pass right through being immune to Farigiraf, hit it with Dark or Bug. Similarly, Gardevoir is Fairy/Psychic, so Dark types are going to be in trouble against her. Poison Type moves would be Super e\x00ect, but be careful with poison type pokemon since the psychic type moves will obliterate them. A good option here is Bisharp, Iron Head is a strong ability and Knock o\x00 and Night slash are some dark moves he learns you can use in the ﬁght. Gym #8 - Glaseado Ice Gym - Grusha ● Frosmoth (Ice/Bug)- Lvl 47 ● Beartic (Ice)- Lvl 47 ● Cetitan (Ice)- Lvl 47 ● Altaria (Dragon/Flying)- Lvl 48 ~Tera into Ice W e a k n e s s : Fire, Rock, Steel, Fighting Cetitan is a HP sponge and has high attack. On top of that it has the ability Thick fat which allows it to absorb 50% of all ﬁre attacks, and is equipped with liquidation to take out your ﬁre pokemon! Consider using rock, steel or ﬁghting against Cetitan instead of ﬁre since it is ready for your ﬁre pokemon! The last and toughest is Altaria, which would normally be x4 weak to Ice is then terastallized into Ice. How to deal with this cloud-bird, if you still have a Bisharp those steel moves will shine here.

So even if a teddiursa is a normal type pokemon it is now a bug type because it terastalized into a bug type and is weak to the same things bugs would be weak too. So treat it the same way you would a bug type.

Wattrel is ﬂying and isn’t a\x00ected by ground moves, and Mismagius is a ghost type with the ability, levitate and thus is immune to ground moves as well. So bringing a ground type isn’t a bad plan, but maybe bringing a pokemon with ground moves is enough to take out luxio and bellibot, then using rock on wattrel to hurt it’s ﬂying type.

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.']]",0.6666666666666666,0.9676914108049757,0.999999999975,0.027777777777777776,1.0,0.49999999875,0.9381102924537502,0.6630990016848661

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting.
