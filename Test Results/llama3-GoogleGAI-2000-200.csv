The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting.

Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game.

Additionally, you can use fast travel by visiting Pokémon Centers and mysterious towers, which can help you navigate the world more easily.","[['This pokemon game is set in the region of Paldea, after a good amount of talking through the beginning of the game you will find there are three main story-lines or Quests to accomplish, and they can be done in any order at any time. The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun. Now all that talking in the tutorial stuff is done. Some quick tips: MAP When you open your map, you might notice it can spin around, which is very disorienting. To prevent this, press the right analog stick and it will make the map always point north, which helped me a ton to STOP getting lost all the time.', 'Go to as many pokemon centers, and mysterious towers as you can, unlock fast travel Fast travel is unlocked immediately in the game. All pokemon centers are fast travel locations. Also if you see a mysterious tower while you’re walking around, it’s probably also a hidden fast travel location, if you climb to the top of it you could unlock a spot to fly to. Also there might be a little gimmighoul there to collect coins from. You have to talk to the other trainers to battle them! Unlike in past games, where they just had to look at you to fight, you now have to go up and talk to the trainers to fight them. I still suggest battling everyone, since you get really nice rewards from the pokemon representatives at the pokemon centers if you battle a certain number of trainers in an area. If you’re not sure if you’ve fought someone or not yet, they will have a yellow text bubble over their head if you have not fought them, if you have they will remain quiet. Pick up items: You will notice pokeballs or shiny things in the world, regular items, things to pick up, EVERYWHERE. Don’t worry too much though, since they do respawn, so don’t worry too much about missing out on this rare item or that special TM. They really are everywhere, but it’s also free stuff and money and money is hard to get in this game. Use your picnics: Something I didn’t understand until way later in the game is how useful the sandwich buffs can be. For example, if you want to level up faster, or make sure you capture that legendary, you can eat a sandwich to help with that. A technique a ton of people use, is in the far northwestern corner of the map by the Team Star-fairy member, Chansey can spawn, and Chansey gives a lot of exp if you KO it. People will eat a Ham Sandwich (#80) to increase Normal encounter rates, to see a lot of chansey’s to power level their pokemon for the Elite four at the end of the game.

The game allows you to just go explore the world at your own pace. This can be a little confusing though since it doesn’t give you a lot of direction about where to go next or who to fight in what order, so I’m going to break it down by each Quest line by the order in which they might be easiest to hardest to fight (you don’t have to fight them in the order I suggest, I did it completely out of order and was fine, though it was tricky.) I also suggest hopping between the three stories as you go, since many of them might be close to each other,either on the map or in level, so don’t worry about going from one story to another, it’s all about having fun.

(Egg power 2 got me about 30 eggs in 30 min). What is the difference between LP and Cash? Not much, you can us either in shops, but you can only us LP to make TM’s at the ™ machine. I also considered using it as a way to make extra cash, if you used all the pokemon ingredients you get and the LP and then sold some high level ™’s then you could make a lot of cash. But in the end should you use LP or cash at the stores, use either, or whichever you have more of. I found I spent a lot of my LP in early since I seemed to have more of it and I couldn’t make any ™’s anyway. It was a good way to keep me well stocked up on lots of pokeballs and greatballs. Tera Raids: Similar to Max Raid Battles, Tera Raids are how you get more LP and also how you can get some pretty strong unique pokemon.

Possible team pokemon: Fidough, The new Paldea Wooper, Houndour, Fletchling, Ralts, Ghastly will appear at night. All these are pretty good to get early and fire pokemon can be tough to get early.

Poison Type moves would be Super e\x00ect, but be careful with poison type pokemon since the psychic type moves will obliterate them.
